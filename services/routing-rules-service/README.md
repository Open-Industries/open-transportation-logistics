# Routing Rules Service

Bounded context: **Routing Rules** — Decision rules binding transport modes to distance and transit-time envelopes.

Alignment: Network policy as auditable rules. Decisions are `ALLOWED` / `DEGRADED` / `DENIED`, always
with the matched rule and a human-readable reason for audit. All data is synthetic.
